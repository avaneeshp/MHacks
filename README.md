<h1>Study Buddy</h1>
This is a study-helper website project made for the hackathon Google x MHacks.

<h3>Description</h3>
This website is an educational tool that helps students who want to effectively review items of content, such as lecture slides, text documents, and images of diagrams. Given a student's inputted educational content, this website can generate summaries so the student can effectively learn the material, as well as generate a quiz for the student to evaluate their knowledge. 

<h3>Services</h3>
A user can input files of the format pdf, jpeg, jpg, png, and txt, and our website will generate and output a summary of each of the files. Then, the user can proceed to request a quiz about all the files it has inputted. On request, the website will create an interactive quiz that can test the user's knowledge.
